# chess-cmd-line-java
a chess game purely in command line (no UI) and not entirely finished :x
it should, at best, be used as learning material

(it should be) launch-able  in IDE <br>
### Features
* all common units and their moves
* devouring pieces
* doesn't have rank up thingy (and inserting it may be difficult)
* checkmates (a little bugged tho)
